		<description>Thanks Justin. Unfortunately the vignetting is not entirely natural. It&#039;s pretty dim in the chapel at night, so some of the vignetting effect can be attributed simply to darker spots on the wall. However, I added some of that and brightened and darkened selected parts in photoshop by painting black and white on a layer set to soft light mode. I&#039;m sure that I also played with curves and saturation a bit.</description>

		<description>Really fantastic shot, Joe.  Is the vignetting natural?  What kind of photoshopping did you do?  The levels are great all around.  Great contrast.</description>

		<description>Joseph, thanks for the compliments. I&#039;m glad that you like this shot. And, you&#039;re right--this place is pretty large so it&#039;s hard to relate that back to how big it actually is and where things really belong in space. I did some looking around and I believe that the ceiling in this building is roughly 50 feet high.</description>
