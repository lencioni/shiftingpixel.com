		<description>Yeah, trivia was a good time, although we didn&#039;t do too well tonight. We took like seventh or something like that. But, we had fun which is what really counts. :)</description>

		<description>I wish I had seen this before we headed for dinner (also at Particks, but we didn&#039;t plan enough time to play, due to packing for NY). Perhapes Ethan and will join you in the future. It looked like fun. Except that at least one of their answers was wrong. Which was unfortunate.</description>
