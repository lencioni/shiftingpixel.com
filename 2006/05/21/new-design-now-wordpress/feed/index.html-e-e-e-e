		<description>Hey Joe, 
I took the liberty to enhance your script a little, and do a little debugging on newer versions of WP and PP, I hope you don&#039;t mind, I gave you credit for the original script. I appreciate the work you did! You can view the post here: http://blog.perfectedperspectives.com/2009/pixelpost-to-wordpress-migration/

Thanks,
Andrew Rodgers

		<description>Well, the script works after all!  

I was ready to handcode the comments into the database when I decided to delete the database and start fresh. After I deleted the database, created it again, and installed Wordpress, I re-imported the Pixelpost using the script and for some odd reason, it worked this time!  The comments and everything. Was it because I started with a fresh clean installed Wordpress?

Again, the while it imported the categories, it didn&#039;t keep the post assignment to them. A minor thing compared to the daunting task of trying hand import the comments directly into the database itself! 

YAY!</description>

		<description>Quick update... importing the pictures DID work.  I didn&#039;t realize I had to actually update load the images themselves to the server in addition to running the script.  (DOH!)

Still no comments, though.  Can anyone help me import the comments, too?

Thanks!</description>

		<description>Hi!
Wanted to add my support for anyone who could upgrade this script!  I tried importing from PixelPost 1.7.1 to Wordpress 2.8.2 this evening.

The script sorta works now... I can import the posts themselves but no comments.  And even with Krista&#039;s added coded, I can not get any images to attach or import into the blog.  

I would really love to use Wordpress because for what I want to do, it would better suit my needs but I don&#039;t want to lose all of my comments or have to manually add all of my photos.</description>

		<description>How did you guys get it to work with Pixelpost 1.7? I can&#039;t get the pixelpost2.php importer to initialize and I get the same error as San. I&#039;ve been trying for 2 years to make a transition from Pixelpost to Wordpress. Once I find a way out of this trap I am sticking with wordpress permanently. Help, Please!? :) Thanks. I may even be willing to fork over some funds for the help!</description>

		<description>Thanks for the script. It worked great from PixelPost 1.7 to Wordpress 2.7.1. I followed Kristarella&#039;s tip and added the image src in 2 spots in the script. thanks for this...you&#039;ve saved me a ton of SQL scripting.</description>
