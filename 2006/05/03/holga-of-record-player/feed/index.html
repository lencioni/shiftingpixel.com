		<description>&lt;strong&gt;Amber&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks for the link. I just ordered a cable release adapter, cable release, and 35mm film adapter for my Holga. While the prices were a little higher than I had expected, I am totally stoked.

You should scan some of the photos from your fisheye and send them my way.</description>

		<description>Over Xmas break I bought this little fisheye camera from an art supply store which included a little book about lomography so I went to the website.. Have you heard of it?.... They mention alot of stuff about Holgas too.  They also have a bunch of other toy-looking cameras like the frogeye and this colorsplash flash thing that looks pretty interesting....   Anyways If you haven&#039;t heard of it yet,   the site is www.lomography.com ! I&#039;m just now getting my film processed from the fisheye camera, so hopefully something turns out!</description>
