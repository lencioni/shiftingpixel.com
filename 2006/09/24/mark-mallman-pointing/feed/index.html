		<description>No way, that&#039;s pretty cool that you and James are friends.

The Sufjan show was really great. The opener, My Brightest Diamond, was a really good show. Shara Worden has a very nice voice and a captivating style.

Sufjan Stevens and his band all came out wearing big wings and bird masks... it was cool. And they played wonderfully. I&#039;ll post some photos of it soon, so stay tuned.</description>

		<description>Thanks Beth, I&#039;m glad you think so. Concert photos are probably some of the most difficult to take because of the crazy crowds, the constantly changing lighting, and the animated musicians.</description>
