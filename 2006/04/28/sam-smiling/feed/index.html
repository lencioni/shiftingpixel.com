		<description>Hey Rob, thanks for the comment. The lower half of her face looks like it&#039;s digitally drawn/from a different picture because of the extremely shallow depth of feild provided by the f/1.4 aperture.

There was actually not a whole lot of post processing done on this photo--I did a small bit of darkening on the right side to bring more focus to her face, a slight curves adjustment layer for added contrast, and a bit of color correction on her hair.</description>

		<description>The lower half of her face looks like it&#039;s digitally drawn/from a different picture.  But I like how focused her eye is.</description>
