		<description>@Ryan: Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to leave a comment. I&#039;m glad you have enjoyed my stuff.

As for this shot, maybe it makes more sense &lt;a href=&quot;http://shiftingpixel.com/category/photos/projects/mostly-context/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;next to some others in this project&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look and let me know what you think.

And, I would love to &lt;a href=&quot;http://shiftingpixel.com/subscribe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;have you as a subscriber&lt;/a&gt; if you&#039;d like to get updates as I post them.</description>
