		<description>Thanks Amber, I&#039;m glad that you like it. Any chance you know what the documentary was called?

I know of a coffee documentary that I have been meaning to watch. It&#039;s called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/black_gold_a_co.php#ch01&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Black Gold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and it focuses on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fair trade&lt;/a&gt; aspect of coffee.</description>

		<description>Oh!!! God I love it!  I just recently watched this show on the history channel or discovery channel (one of the two) about the history of coffee; how the first coffee came from Ethiopia when this guy&#039;s goats didn&#039;t come home one evening so he went out looking for them... When he found them the goats were running around all revved up on something and were eating these seeds off a tree.  So the guy ate some and felt energized and amazing and so it began...  Anyways it was real interesting.   I prefer tea, but I still looooove coffee, and have a serious obsession with small spherical objects in mass quantity.  So thanks for taking this photo.</description>
