		<description>6. Throw out the kit lens
Please,these are so bad a nice lens right away will help you in the long run
Sony is running a deal where you can buy a A55 body w/out a kit lens and get a 55-200MM for the same price with a 100$ discount where the kit lens will cease to exist</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I am looking to (once that I can afford it) purchase a new lens for sports photography as my current telephoto zoom just isn’t quick enough&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I don&#039;t know if it has enough zoom for your taste, but I adore my &lt;a href=&quot;http://shiftingpixel.com/category/photos/lenses/canon-ef-70-200mm-f28l-is-usm/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s a bit big, heavy, and expensive, but it is very versatile and produces some beautiful images.</description>

		<description>I ended up getting the Canon 400D (XTi Rebel), 18-55kit lens and a Sigma 70-300 APO DG Macro lens.

I don&#039;t really have any regrets truth be told, however, I am looking to (once that I can afford it) purchase a new lens for sports photography as my current telephoto zoom just isn&#039;t quick enough. I could really do with purchasing a telephoto zoom with the same sort of zoom but with an f2.8 aperture. The light is awful in these autumn/winter months here in the UK.

I took a look at your equipment, and you have some nice stuff there!</description>

		<description>@Aidan: Thanks, I&#039;m glad you like my tips.

Out of curiosity, what did you end up getting? What are your regrets? Were there any unexpected bonuses?</description>

		<description>Nice summary! The only addition I would make, is: first start thinking about item #3, then #2 and then #1  :-)</description>
