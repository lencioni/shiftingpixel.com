		<description>The only reason i even decided to look into this type of ant is because they are all over the beach islands in the philippines when i vacationed out there. not sure about any of the other asian countries but the philippines definately.</description>

		<description>Well, I didn&#039;t really.  I have an anthropology background, so I know a lot about primates--but I just used the same resources I have for looking up primate taxonomy and information, and did some quick reading/skimming about &lt;em&gt;Acanthomyops&lt;/em&gt; based on those results.

Anyway, even though I&#039;m focusing more on archaeology these days, I still have a strong interest in taxonomy and phylogeny, so these little questions really interest me.  :-)</description>

		<description>@Daniel: Yes, I think you are correct. These &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myrmecos.net/formicinae/LasOcc3.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myrmecos.net/formicinae/LasOcc1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; especially look similar.

Thanks so much for the link! This mystery seems to have been solved (at least well enough so I can finally sleep at night again). How did you know about these ants?</description>

		<description>It seems a little hard to tell from this photo alone, but you&#039;re probably right about the species.  Could be &lt;em&gt;Lasius&lt;/em&gt;, of which &lt;em&gt;Acanthomyops&lt;/em&gt; is sometimes considered a subgenus.  Have a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myrmecos.net/formicinae/lasius.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and see what you think.</description>
