		<description>Thanks for the nice comments everybody. RobW - i&#039;m looking forward to seeing your similar shot. bob - thanks for the tips. i&#039;ll play around with it in noise ninja some more. I&#039;ve never used noiseware before, is it better? Also, I was going to take a closer shot like you suggested, but I really wanted to get that fence in there. I wish I had a wider lens so I could get more sky on this one.</description>

		<description>Great shot - love the light and sky...

--- run it through noiseware -- or ninja -- but filter for LOW noise -- or LOW color noise ... that should help you a bit .. be sure to smart sharpen (or unsharp mask) afterwards... I like this shot... If you go back the next full moon, perhaps take a lower position closer to the cabin - and point your camera up towards the sky... You may find you&#039;ll get a really dramatic shot using that technique...</description>

		<description>The lighting on the building is excellent and I like the beginnings of the star trail in the sky.</description>
