		<description>Mac: Thanks for your compliment. Sorry I don&#039;t have the lens listed in my equipment. It&#039;s because I actually don&#039;t own the lens&#8212;I borrow it from work.

In any case, it&#039;s the only wide-angle lens that I have had the opportunity to use, so I don&#039;t know if I can make any sort of a recommendation for you. However, based on my use, it has been quite nice (and would be even nicer with a full-frame camera like the 5D). Still, compared to my Tamron lens, some of the color seems to be a bit different with this lens&#8212;especially saturated reds seem to turn out more of a magenta. But, that could totally be my camera&#039;s fault.

The lens is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3279&amp;navigator=4&quot;&gt;Sigma 15mm f/2.8 EX AF&lt;/a&gt;. It received good ratings and reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fredmiranda.com/reviews/showproduct.php?product=76&amp;sort=7&amp;cat=38&amp;page=1&quot;&gt;Fred Miranda&lt;/a&gt; and is relatively inexpensive.</description>

		<description>You don&#039;t seem to list a lens on your about page that is capable of 15mm focal lengths. I would be quite interested in exactly what lens it is that you are using. (Mostly because I am in search of a nice wideangle lens)

While I agree with Miles, I&#039;d have to say that it&#039;s the stars that do it for me. Also, anything to do with hangers seems to always be cool.</description>
