		<description>1. Hey, these colors are gorgeous, you did an exceptional job with this image.

2. I share your frustration with corporate america&#039;s tendency to homogenize most of the planet into a junk heap of cheap commodities.  Our local businesses are being gentrified at an incredible rate and I&#039;m glad to hear others are equally pissed off about it.  I&#039;ve got a few shots along the same lines myself and since I&#039;m heading back to the US after 5 years abroad I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have more to come.  Plus I love the commentary, keep it up...

3. I&#039;m using your Pepper, it&#039;s great to have the comment list next to my stats, well done sir.</description>
