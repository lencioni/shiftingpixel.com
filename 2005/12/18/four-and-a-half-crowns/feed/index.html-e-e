		<description>As I was shooting these cabinets, one of the music faculty walked by and asked what I was photographing. I responded with, &quot;I really like these cabinets.&quot; He said, &quot;Good, at least someone does.&quot; They are definitely starting to show their use.

Thanks for the comment Rob. It&#039;s good to see you back.</description>
