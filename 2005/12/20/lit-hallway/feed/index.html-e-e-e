		<description>I don&#039;t feel the shot is a &quot;straight forward photograph&quot; so I don&#039;t feel it needs the flair on the right to make it more interesting. The texture of the brick wall is intriguing enough that I don&#039;t feel it needs another &quot;layer&quot;. As for the balance issue I find the composition quite balanced anyway. There is a definite split down the middle between the left/light side and right/dark side. Each side is strong enough to counteract the other. If anything I believe the flair shifts the interest to the right, throwing of the balance because it DOES &quot;jump right out at you&quot;.</description>

		<description>Sam: actually you are wrong. It was pretty dark when I took this shot, so there wasn&#039;t much outside light at all. And if I remember correctly, this particular hallway doesn&#039;t have any windows either, only a couple skylights (which actually provide quite a bit of light during the day).

orange: It&#039;s interesting how you find the lens flare distracting. I thought about cloning it out, but in the end I decided to keep it.

I actually ended up liking it quite a bit because it nicely compliments the shape, style, and color of the blurry lights on the left and also adds another layer of depth that is so close to the camera that it almost just jumps right out at you. Also, I just like the abstractness of it being injected into what is otherwise a fairly straightforward photograph. And, on a composition side of things, I think it nicely balances out the darkness of the right half of the shot. What are your thoughts?

ROB: There is actually not much of anything else down the hall, just a row of lights on the one side. At the end of the hall on the wall there is a painting hanging up.</description>

		<description>Certainly is huge DOF. Such a tight focal point leaves you wondering about what is futher down the wall, but then I expect that is the point.</description>

		<description>Great shot . Wonderful color. I don&#039;t think its over-saturated. Makes an interesting abstraction. I do however find the lens flares a little distracting.</description>

		<description>I like this one, Joe. All the oranges, blues, and greens are really cool. I assume it&#039;s outdoor light vs indoor light but I&#039;m probably wrong.</description>
