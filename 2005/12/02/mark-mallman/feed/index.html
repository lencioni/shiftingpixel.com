		<description>Yeah, this was actually taken the night that his girlfriend broke up with him, so he was pretty emotional. He had a hoodie on before the show and I went up to him to chat a big and I said, &quot;Mallman, you look like Edward Scissorhands tonight, what&#039;s up?&quot; and he responded, &quot;Good, it&#039;ll be easier to cut off your cock.&quot; Hehe.

But, if you think photo shows his emotion, you should see him live. He is nuts. I seriously cannot recommend a Mallman show enough.

I&#039;m glad you stopped by, Phil.</description>
