		<description>You&#039;re right of course. HDR should only be used to recover shadow detail, and blown highlights - all that jazz with halos and platic looking photos is just not the way. And ypu control the effect very nicely. It is actually hard to tell that the photos you refer to are HDR at all.

I&#039;d love to share my work with you, but my web-host just killed my wordpress site, by trying to upgrade from PHP4 to PHP5, and now i have no database at all. But when i get it up and running again, i&#039;d be happy to share.

BTW - the look of your site is awesome - petty you wont share the theme :) ( i would take it in a heartbeat)</description>

		<description>Yeah, I definitely prefer full frame for the kind of stuff I like to shoot. It is always hard to pick up my clunky 10D after getting used to the 5D.

Keep experimenting with HDR, but try not to fall into the trap of making your photos look overprocessed. Here&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://shiftingpixel.com/tag/HDR/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some of the HDR stuff that I&#039;ve done&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shifting-Pixel/6505867868&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;promotion on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/shiftingpixel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;follow Shifting Pixel on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; as well if you are into that.</description>

		<description>Thank you for your quick reply.

After having used the Canon 20D ever since it came out, i actually just bought a 5D (the old one), and i love it. I&#039;m not saying that full frame is the answer to all my head aches conserning the hunt for unique photographs - but i sure helps.

I&#039;ve also resently begun to experiment with HDR, but i found, that photoshop was a bit unrefined when i came to processing the 32 bit image. It blends and aligns images beautifully, but the lack of editing options was a ral let down. But then i discovered a little 99$ programme called Photomatix.
I&#039;m sure i&#039;ve heard of it, but if you havn&#039;t, you should try it. My newly purcased 5D plus the photomatix has really gotten my creative juices flowing again, and as mentioned before, the heeps of inspiration i draw from your site.

Keep up the good work, and if you should ever feel like showing a before and after photograph, from raw to finished picture, i would love to see it. You seem to get so much out of really simple equipement (i mean everybody can afford a 50mm and a 10/20/30D if they are at all interested in taking pictures)

I hope i can inspire some of my friends to join your site on Facebook - i know i have!

Ps. I&#039;m danish, so i apologize for any mis spelling</description>

		<description>Thanks for the kind words Peter. I&#039;m glad you like my work.

I guess a lot of the saturation you are probably talking about comes from post production but it also depends on the scene or the subject that I&#039;m shooting. I shoot only in camera raw which gives me some more flexibility in that area while maintaining a quality image.

I have access to both a Canon 5D and a Canon 5D MKII that I occasionally use but I don&#039;t personally own one. For the most part, I&#039;ve been in a slump myself for a while (as you&#039;ve probably noticed from the lack of updates here). The 5D series of cameras is very nice and I&#039;m really excited to see what is yet to come from Canon.</description>

		<description>Hey man.

Love your site, and your photos serve as great inspiration. You&#039;ve helped me getting out of a slump, where all of my photos started to look alike.
I like the saturated colors you have in a lot of your photos. Do you saturate them i post produktion (camera raw, photoshp or whatever) or have you tweaked the picture style in your camera, or is it just a product of the motives you choose?

Have you switched to full frame (Canon 5D)?</description>
