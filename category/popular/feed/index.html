			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="leadin">A ridiculously easy-to-use <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> script for resizing images the smart way.</span></p>
<p>One of the challenges that comes with maintaining a graphic-intensive website like <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com">Shifting Pixel</a> is finding a way to get high quality images throughout the site with as little effort as possible. To tackle this, I developed the Smart Image Resizer and have been using it around the site for the past few months. I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>
<p>The major advantage of this script is that it allows me to resize and crop any image on my website <em>without touching the actual image or writing any code</em>. I upload each image once at a high enough resolution and can then reuse it at any size I want, anywhere I want. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the images are in a post, on a page, or in a template file&#8211;it just works. <small>All of the magic is done through the query string part of the URL in the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>img</code> tag.</small></p>
<p>And, if this wasn&#8217;t a big enough time-saver for me right now, it&#8217;ll be a huge time-saver the next time I decide to redesign my site. It&#8217;s a relief that I won&#8217;t have to go through to resize and re-upload a thousand photos to make sure they look right&#8211;I&#8217;ll just have to change the links to them and I&#8217;ll be all set.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resizes <acronym title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</acronym>s, <acronym title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</acronym>s, and <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym>s</li>
<li>Intelligently sharpens for crisp photos at any size</li>
<li>Can crop based on width:height ratios</li>
<li>Can color-fill transparent GIFs and PNGs</li>
<li>Built-in caching keeps image variations for optimal performance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p><a href="http://php.net">PHP 5.1.0+</a> compiled with <a href="http://php.net/gd">GD</a>. (<em>You need a version of GD that supports <code>imageconvolution()</code>, such as the bundled version. Note that on some distributions, the default php-gd package may not be adequate.</em>)</p>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/smart-lencioni-image-resizer/">Download SLIR 2.0</a></p>
<p><a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/downloads/image-1.4.1.zip">Download Smart Image Resizer v1.4.1</a> <small>(Released August 6, 2008)</small></p>

<h3>To Install</h3>
<ol>
<li>Unzip on your web server</li>
<li>In the same directory, create a directory called &#8220;imagecache&#8221;</li>
<li>Make your imagecache directory is writable by the web server (usually <code>chmod 775</code>)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn on &#8220;display_errors = on&#8221; in your php.ini file. Restart Apache and verify with a phpinfo().</li>
<li>Try visiting the URL that you are using as the <code>src</code> attribute of your <code>img</code> tag directly in the browser. For example, for example, stick this in your browser&#8217;s address bar: <code>http://example.com/image.php?width=180&amp;height=180&amp;image=/path/to/image.jpg</code>. If there is an error message here, it should be quite helpful.</li>
<li>If that doesn’t give you any information, turn on error reporting (add <code>error_reporting(E_ALL);</code> to the top of image.php) and see if that gives you any information. It is possible that the script is trying to use a function that doesn’t exist in your installation and configuration of PHP.</li>
<li>If you can’t get the script to give you any information, try peaking into your error logs.</li>
<li>Finally, if you can’t get any information out of any of these things, run a <code>phpinfo()</code> and <a href="mailto:joe@shiftingpixel.com">send me a link</a>–if I have time I’ll take a look at it and tell you if anything looks out of the ordinary. As of this time, I am spending more time focusing on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/smart-lencioni-image-resizer/">SLIR 2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Common error messages</h4>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Fatal error:</strong> Call to undefined function imagecreatetruecolor()</dt>
<dd>This most likely means that you do not have GD installed. To fix this, install GD (make sure you are using a version that includes the <code>imageconvolution()</code> function).</dd>
<dt><strong>Fatal error:</strong> Call to undefined function imageconvolution()</dt>
<dd>This means that you are using a version of GD that does not include the <code>imageconvolution()</code> function. To fix this, you will either need to find a repository that includes the version of GD that you need, or <a href="http://cumu.li/2008/5/13/recompiling-php5-with-bundled-support-for-gd-on-ubuntu">compile php-gd from source</a>.</dd>

<p>At the time, I had never used lights before in my photography and, to be completely honest, I was a little scared of the prospect. I had to learn a lot in a short amount of time so I needed a solid resource. After a little research, I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLight-Science-Introduction-Photographic-Lighting%2Fdp%2F0240808193%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fp%3D304485601%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dlpo-top-stripe-2%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D201%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3D0240802756%26pf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0C1TZMG5N7GE7HE633Q9&#038;tag=shifpixe0b-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325"><cite>Light: Science and Magic</cite></a> to get things started. I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>
<p>Fil Hunter, Steven Biver, and Paul Fuqua ease the novice reader in with very basic lighting concepts focused on two-dimensional subjects. Each chapter builds until you have an understanding of how to light complicated objects like metal and glass. The diagrams and supporting pictures clearly illustrate the concepts, and the writing is very natural and easy to understand. When I finished the book, I had the know-how and confidence to light just about any project.</p>
<p>This is such a great book because the authors teach the principles of lighting instead of just showing you how to achieve certain effects or lighting styles. These principles can be applied to many situations and utilized to achieve any effect you desire. In other words, you won&#8217;t find just a lighting cookbook here. Rather, read this book and you will learn how to <em>think</em> about lighting and understand it from the ground up. This puts you in control of how your photos will look.</p>
<p>If you want to get started with lighting, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLight-Science-Introduction-Photographic-Lighting%2Fdp%2F0240808193%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fp%3D304485601%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dlpo-top-stripe-2%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D201%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3D0240802756%26pf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0C1TZMG5N7GE7HE633Q9&#038;tag=shifpixe0b-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325"><cite>Light: Science and Magic</cite></a> is an essential read.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="leadin"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_(typesetting)">Justified text</a> on the web, at this point, is <a href="http://www.astheria.com/design/choosing-type-alignments-fortheweb">almost always a bad idea</a>. When designing a website, it&#8217;s simple enough to not use the dreadful <code>text-align: justify;</code> but <em>what is the casual browser of the World Wide Web to&nbsp;do?</em></p>
<p>If you are as fed up as I am with rivers of whitespace flowing through the blocks of fully justified text on the web and sweeping your attention away from the important stuff <small>(the content!)</small>, there&#8217;s no doubt that you&#8217;ll want to take matters away from good-intentioned amateur designers and into your own hands.</p>
<p>Just drag this link, <a href="javascript:function%20B_Unjustify(){var%20el=document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].getElementsByTagName('*');if(el.length){for(i=0;i<el.length;i++){if(document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(el[i],null).getPropertyValue('text-align')=='justify'){el[i].style.textAlign='left';}}}};B_Unjustify();">Unjustify</a>, to your bookmarks toolbar. Next time you come across some justified text, you get to zap it.</p>
<h3>Try it out</h3>
<p>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Sutra">Heart Sutra</a> as translated by <a href="http://www.empty-universe.com/prajnaparamita/heartsutra.htm">Nalanda Translation Committee</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.empty-universe.com/prajnaparamita/heartsutra.htm" style="text-align: justify;"><p>Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form. Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness. In the same way, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are emptiness. Thus, Shariputra, all dharmas are emptiness. There are no characteristics. There is no birth and no cessation. There is no impurity and no purity. There is no decrease and no increase. Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness, there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no formation, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no dharmas, no eye dhatu up to no mind dhatu, no dhatu of dharmas, no mind consciousness dhatu; no ignorance, no end of ignorance up to no old age and death, no end of old age and death; no suffering, no origin of suffering, no cessation of suffering, no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment.</p></blockquote>

<script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>
<p class="leadin">It&#8217;s probably the question I get asked the most…</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the market for a new pro-quality, digital, <acronym title="Single Lens Reflex">SLR</acronym> camera and I wonder if you can tell me what type and model and megapixels you use personally….&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These tips could save you some valuable time and money.<span id="more-706"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Tip 1.</strong> Identify how much you can afford to spend.</h3>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not rich and since camera equipment can get really expensive really fast, this tops my list of considerations. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense to go bankrupt just to buy a new tool or toy.</p>
<p>Look at your personal budget and make sure you can afford a new camera <em>and all of the additional goodies you are going to need to get with it</em>. Take into account lenses, filters, cleaning supplies, extra batteries, memory cards, remote, software, tripod, backpack, light meter, and lighting equipment you plan on getting. If it all doesn&#8217;t pan out, maybe it&#8217;s best to wait or to get something cheaper like <a href="http://www.holgamods.com/">an awesome Holga toy camera</a> to hold you off for a while. <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/tag/holga/">I love my Holga</a>, and I got it <em>after</em> my <acronym title="Digital Single Lens Reflex">DSLR</acronym>. Or, try your hand at pinhole photography—there&#8217;s a whole world of inexpensive possibilities out there.</p>
<p>Most importantly, get out there and take pictures with whatever you have or can get your hands on. The tools you have or can cheaply get probably aren&#8217;t limiting your ability to cultivate the oh-so-important artistic skills of photography and composition. <strong>Start <em>seeing</em> now and the technology will catch up to you.</strong> If you want proof or inspiration, take a look at <a href="http://outafocus.my-expressions.com/">Susan Burnstine&#8217;s outafocus</a> or <a href="http://www.640x480.net/">Michael Daniel&#8217;s 640&#215;480.net</a>. They are producing some incredible work using very low-fi equipment.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 2.</strong> Decide what you want out of your camera.</h3>
<p>If you already have a decent camera sitting around, take a long, hard look at what you really want to get out of the latest and greatest model.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my Canon 10D for a number of years now and it still does just about everything that I want it to do, even though it has been replaced by the 20D and the 30D. I would really <em>like</em> to have a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11933">Canon 5D</a> because it performs better at higher <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> settings and has a delicious full-frame sensor. But, when I critically look at what I have and what I would be getting by spending a few thousand dollars on a newer model, the difference just doesn&#8217;t add up for me. It would have a much better impact on image quality if I bought some really nice lenses, or maybe a lighting setup.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 3.</strong> Think about how you will use your camera.</h3>
<p><strong>A camera is a tool.</strong> The right tool in the right hands <em>for the right job</em> can produce breathtaking images. But that&#8217;s just it—you need the right camera for the right job.</p>
<p>If you need to do a lot of inconspicuous street shooting, then you&#8217;ll want to find yourself something smaller like a <a href="http://www.leica-camera.us/photography/m_system/m8/">Leica M8</a> or a <a href="http://sigma-dp1.com/">Sigma DP1</a>. If you tend to be rough with your equipment, stay away from cameras with cheaper, plastic bodies like Canon&#8217;s Rebel line. If you are going to be doing a lot of shooting in low-light conditions, focus on cameras that perform better at higher <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> settings, like the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11933">Canon 5D</a>.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the camera you buy needs to fit how you are going to use it. If it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s an expensive paper weight—it will sit on the shelf and collect dust. You&#8217;ll wonder why you didn&#8217;t just buy a cheaper and more convenient point and shoot.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 4.</strong> Establish how you want to use your photos.</h3>
<p>Are your photos going to be for a personal photo album, an online gallery, or gigantic fine art prints?</p>
<p>This question weaves directly into the long-time discussion on megapixels. Do you want to display your photos publicly or just look at them for fun? If you want to display them publicly, do you want to ever print them or just put them on the web? If you are printing your photos, will you ever want them printed at large sizes?</p>
<p>Basically, if you don&#8217;t ever want to print anything at 20&#8243; x 30&#8243;, then you probably don&#8217;t really have to worry too much about megapixels these days. If you are only going to use your pictures on the web, megapixels pretty much don&#8217;t matter at all. And, if you never plan on publicly showing your photos, <em>who cares about megapixels</em>?</p>
<p>For me, the 10D has 6.3 megapixels, which is about as low as I would want to go. I can print a 20&#8243; x 30&#8243; at pretty good quality, but if you look closely it could be a little better. Fortunately, most of the stuff I print is smaller than that so that&#8217;s not that big of a deal—although it would be nice to have a little more flexibility. All of Canon&#8217;s <acronym title="Digital Single Lens Reflex">DSLR</acronym>s right now have 8 megapixels or more, which is plenty for mostly anybody.</p>
<p>If you want to make something really big but don&#8217;t necessarily have the megapixels, try <a href="http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/">Rasterbating</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 5.</strong> Find out what others use and how well it works for them.</h3>
<p><em>Learn from those who have gone before you.</em></p>
<p>Find other photographers whose work you admire and then find out what equipment they are using. This will give you some real-world examples of how the equipment performs and the results it delivers.</p>
<p>If you read a lot of photoblogs, many have a page just to list the equipment they use—<a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/about/my-equipment">here&#8217;s my equipment list</a>. Take advantage of this.</p>
<p>Tap into the power of the Internet. <em>Do your research.</em> There are some very excellent photography review websites that I rely on when considering new purchases—<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/">Digital Photography Review</a>, <a href="http://www.fredmiranda.com/">fredmiranda.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/">Luminous Landscape</a> have all been very helpful for me. Try checking out reviews on Amazon.com or searching and posting in the <a href="http://www.photo.net/community/">photo.net forums</a>. At minimum, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/">check out Flickr&#8217;s Camera Finder</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure to <strong>ask very specific questions</strong> and to <strong>provide as much relevant information as possible</strong>. Simply asking &#8220;what camera should I get?&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to illicit a very valuable response if the person you are asking doesn&#8217;t know how much you want to spend, what you want out of a camera, how you are going to use a camera, and how you want to use your photos. Figure these things out and people will be much more helpful.</p>
<h3><strong>Bonus Tip.</strong> Maximize your investment.</h3>
<p>Look at what you already have and look at what you will get.</p>
<p>After you know what you need and expect to get out of a camera, take stock of the lenses and accessories you already own <em>as well as</em> the additional things you plan to get. Then, try to find an camera that fits in with all of that equipment.</p>
<p>For instance, if you already have a lot of really nice Canon lenses, there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ll get the most bang for your buck out of buying a new Canon body. If you don&#8217;t have any lenses yet, it might be best to start with a cheaper or older body and put the extra money into buying some really decent lenses. Plus this gives you the freedom to consider the qualities and differences of various lens systems and pick the one that will best suit your needs.</p>
<p>All in all, you&#8217;ll be happiest with your purchase if you can spend some time really thinking about what you need and how you plan on using it—otherwise you are just buying an expensive toy.</p>

With Sam&#8217;s help last night, I made my first cake. And it was <em>from scratch</em>. We haven&#8217;t tasted it yet because we finished frosting it at about 1 a.m., but to me it looks absolutely divine. <strong>Update:</strong> We tried the cake and it is awesome. Although, next time I think I would add some salt to the ganache and maybe use a higher quality chocolate that isn&#8217;t quite as sweet&#8230; We used Baker&#8217;s semi-sweet which is good, but it comes across in the ganache as maybe a little too sugary.</p>
<p>We made the <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/101275">Double Chocolate Layer Cake off of Epicurious</a> because it had so many positive reviews. We figured that we couldn&#8217;t really go wrong.</p>
<h3>Brewing Another Batch</h3>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m going up to the cities visit my friend, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/abayerl">Anthony Bayerl</a>, and help him brew his first batch of beer. So, in a way this will be <strong>a weekend of firsts</strong>. He got his brewing kit for Christmas, so he&#8217;s pretty excited to get his first batch brewing. I&#8217;ll probably pick up some ingredients while I&#8217;m up there as well. Wish us luck!</p>
<p>And, be sure to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/abayerl">check out Anthony&#8217;s music</a>. He&#8217;s a good guy and has a lot of talent. Acoustic guitar + singing, so what&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p>

I was crouched down for a photo and one of the tigers jumped up right in front of me and put its paws on the glass. It was quite intimidating.
