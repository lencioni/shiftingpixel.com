			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="leadin">Wow. This past year went fast.</span> So fast that I am forced to break <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2006/07/30/why-i-will-be-featuring-5-photographers-in-5-days/">with</a> <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2007/07/30/two-years/">tradition</a> this year and won&#8217;t be having a bunch of guests posting.</p>
<p>In any case, thank you for sticking around so long. I hope that you keep coming back for more and keep on leaving comments even if they are short and snappy&#8211;they are often quite encouraging.</p>

<li>January, 2008 &mdash; purchased my first set of <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/about/my-equipment/">lighting equipment</a> and taught myself how to light photographs with some help from <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2008/01/28/review-light-science-and-magic-third-edition/"><cite>Light: Science and Magic</cite></a> <small>(<em>highly</em> recommended)</small>.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="leadin">I&#8217;m excited to announce that I currently have an art show up at <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/tag/river-rock/">River Rock Coffee</a></span> in Saint Peter, Minnesota. It features fourteen photographs from Shifting Pixel and runs from May 6 through a week or two into June.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my work in art shows before but this is my first solo show, so it&#8217;s pretty cool to see my work publicly displayed. It gives me a good feeling of accomplishment. The feedback I&#8217;ve received so far has been positive, so it has been encouraging as well.</p>
<p>If you happen to be in town, make sure you cruise down to the River Rock and check it out. While you are there, be sure to get some coffee or a bite to eat&#8211;they make some delicious things.</p>
<p><strong>Update (March 1, 2009): </strong>In case you missed it, I put together <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/category/river-rock-coffee-may-6-2008/">all of the work I had in the show right here</a>. Enjoy.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="leadin">Shifting Pixel <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2006/12/21/now-in-9rules-network/">was accepted</a> into the <a href="http://9rules.com">9rules network</a> at the end of 2006. The leaf at the top of each page represents my membership in and support for that community.</p>
<p>When I was accepted as a member, I had hoped that Shifting Pixel would get a little more traffic and that maybe I would be able to hang out with some of the cool kids on the Internet. I didn&#8217;t know exactly what to expect, but it all seemed positive.</p>
<p>Now that I have been in 9rules for nearly a year&#8211;interacting with the bosses, fellow members, and other community members&#8211;I have gotten to know more intimately what 9rules is all about. There are some good people in 9rules, and I have really enjoyed getting to know them over the past ten months. Relationships have begun that I am happy to have.</p>
<p>This Tuesday <small>(tomorrow)</small>, 9rules will be undergoing a massive change codenamed Ali2. This entails, among other things <small>(like sweet new features that I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of previewing)</small>, a <a href="http://9rules.com/blog/2007/10/staying-true-to-your-purpose/">new member agreement</a> that requires member participation in either the member-only forums or in my.9r, the world-wide-open forums. Since I have already been participating in the forums over there, the new member agreement doesn&#8217;t make me <em>do</em> anything new in order to stay with 9rules. It did, however, cause me to reexamine my status as a member and the direction that the network is heading.</p>
<p>The destination for 9rules, as far as I can tell, is that of a strong community. I know that the seeds are there, and given a little time, it will grow into one of the best communities on the Internet. I can honestly say that it is the best virtual community I have ever been part of and I am really looking forward to where Ali2 will take us. Therefore, I am recommitting to 9rules and hope to be able to give back to it what I have already received.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t done so already, I encourage you to check out the community and get to know some of the people <a href="http://9rules.com">over there</a>. Ask some questions and join in on some conversations. It&#8217;s just a good place to hang out.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://shiftingpixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/pink.png' alt='Pink for October Shifting Pixel' class="right" /><br />
Just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November#Month-long_observances">November is beard month</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October#Health_observances">October is breast cancer awareness month</a>. To help raise breast cancer awareness, I have decided to take part in an international movement that is causing websites across the globe <a href="http://pinkforoctober.org">to go pink for the month of October</a>. Here&#8217;s the deal:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://pinkforoctober.org/about/"><p>Web sites will Go Pink during the month of October to bring attention to Breast Cancer Awareness Month, get people talking about breast cancer, and raise money for research.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://usabilityworks.org/">Matthew Oliphant</a>, this is actually the second year that websites will be going pink for October and will hopefully be a big and successful year for the cause. If you have a website, I encourage you to do the same thing and actually make a difference for once.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="leadin">It&#8217;s tough to believe that I started Shifting&nbsp;Pixel <em>two years ago</em>. It has been pretty great so far.</p>
<p>And, <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2006/07/30/why-i-will-be-featuring-5-photographers-in-5-days/">keeping with tradition</a>, I&#8217;m throwing a party.</p>
<p>Last year, I invited some of the photographers who had influenced me to guest post over here. Since it was so much fun to be able to showcase their work on my website, I figured, &#8220;hey, what the heck, let&#8217;s try this thing again.&#8221; Except this time there&#8217;s a new twist.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been hanging out here since December, you probably know that <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2006/12/21/now-in-9rules-network/">I made it into the 9rules network</a>. So, this year I&#8217;m excited to invite some of my fellow 9rules members to the party. Let me introduce them.</p>
<h3>The Guest Photographers Are&#8230;</h3>
<h4>Dave Wild</h4>
<p><a href="http://publicenergy.co.uk/" rel="acquaintance"><img src='http://shiftingpixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/davewild_280px.jpg' alt='Dave Wild' class="gutter" />Dave</a> is a photographer from Nottinghamshire in the United Kingdom. He is married to a Nikon D50 but has move fun with the two mistresses that are a modified infrared Fuji Finepix S5600 and a Lomo Supersampler. He knows they&#8217;re cheap but he can&#8217;t resist them.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in 2003 and decided to use mountain biking as a way to get fit. While out on the bike he enjoyed the countryside and decided to start taking photos. Since then the camera has been more of an addiction than the bike has and it has developed into something that now forms a large part of his life. In 2005 Dave started experimenting with digital infrared photography and that has also ballooned in to a major focus and after three years of using a normal digital camera for infrared shots, he recently purchased a camera that had been modified just for infrared use. That marks the start of another exciting period.</p>
<h4>Nils Geylen</h4>
<p><a href="http://nodependenciesnologo.wordpress.com/" rel="acquaintance"><img src='http://shiftingpixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/nils280shifitingpixel.jpg' alt='Nils Geylen' class="gutter" />Nils</a> is a 36-year old kid from Antwerp. Belgium. Europe. He currently lives off new media and the fresh fumes of city buses, which he takes each day on his commute to the small <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> firm he recently started work.</p>
<p>Nils can&#8217;t choose between the page and the picture, so he foolhardily tries to combine the two. He blogs at <a href="http://nodependenciesnologo.wordpress.com/" rel="acquaintance">NDNL</a>, and tries posting a picture a day on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/napfisk/" rel="acquaintance">Flickr</a>. Writing came at an early age, but Nils discovered photography in college where his media classes taught him what a dark room really looks like on the inside. These days, like so many others, he simply dabbles in digital. Everywhere he goes, the surroundings present themselves like stills from a nouvelle-vague movie. He&#8217;s definitely not an artist, but when people like his shots, he tends to like the people. Easy does it, right?</p>
<h4>Jeff Ngan</h4>
<p><a href="http://equivocality.com" rel="acquaintance"><img src='http://shiftingpixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/jeff.jpg' alt='Jeff Ngan' class="gutter" />Jeff</a> is an amateur photographer who took up the camera as a better way to document his life. He currently spends his time updating <a href=" http://equivocality.com" rel="acquaintance">his blog</a>, practicing Tai Chi, and pondering the Tao.</p>
<h4>Andrew Faulkner</h4>
<p><a href="http://fadtastic.net" rel="acquaintance"><img src='http://shiftingpixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/fadtastic.gif' alt='Fadtastic logo' class="gutter" />Andrew Faulkner</a> takes random photos but spends more time as the administrator at <a href="http://fadtastic.net" rel="acquaintance">fadtastic.net</a>. fadtastic.net is a multi-author web design trends journal. The authors have a passion for web design and particularly web design trends&mdash;whether they be graphical, typographical or maybe standards-related. It’s all here, so why not stay a while?</p>
<h3>A Few Additional Features</h3>
<p>I also decided to add a couple of nice little features that you may have noticed if you&#8217;ve stopped by in the past few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had been missing my <abbr title="Exchangeable image file format">Exif</abbr> data <small>(the exposure info that shows up below most of my photos now)</small> ever <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2006/05/21/new-design-now-wordpress/">since I moved from Pixelpost to WordPress</a>, so I&#8217;m really happy to see that back in action.</li>
<li>If I typed in a description for a photo when I uploaded it, the description didn&#8217;t end up getting used anywhere on my site. Well, now it does. Now, occasionally there will be a little extra info for some photos.</li>
<li>Jeff wanted to do a series of photos so his post would be more like a photo essay. I was excited about this but hadn&#8217;t set things up to do it. Now I have. I think that it&#8217;s pretty cool and I hope you like it.</li>
<li>Although I don&#8217;t know if this is a &#8220;new feature&#8221; per se, it is new&#8230; I&#8217;ve been making some design tweaks here and there that add up to somewhat of a small refreshining for the site. I hope you like what I&#8217;ve done with the place <small>(if you notice anything out of the ordinary, please let me know)</small>. I have some more ideas in store that I will implement whenever I get time, so keep your eyes peeled for that.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="leadin">Tonight I finally put the new design for Shifting Pixel that I&#8217;ve been banging out for the past few weeks and retiring a good design <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/2006/05/21/new-design-now-wordpress/">that I&#8217;ve had up since May</a>.</p>
<p><img src='http://shiftingpixel.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/shifting-pixel-screenshot.jpg' alt='Shifting Pixel screenshot' /></p>
<h3>Why change?</h3>
<p>While I really liked my previous design, I feel that the new one is easier to use and just makes a lot more sense when considering some of the new things that I have been doing with Shifting Pixel since the last design. I know, it&#8217;s a big departure from what I previously had, but I feel not only had I outgrown the previous design but also this is a step in the right direction. With this redesign I wanted to examine each piece of the website and figure out how to make it work better. Hopefully I have accomplished that.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s this design all about?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest changes that you might notice is that I have moved from a 700 pixel wide format to 940 pixels wide. This may affect some of you, but hopefully won&#8217;t be too annoying. Hardware is improving rapidly and soon enough most people will be running 1024&#215;768 anyway.</p>
<p>I paid closer attention to a number of items with this redesign than I have in the past. For instance, I wanted a good, strong, simple, structured, and meaningful logo. The rectangle of my new logo represents a photo and matches the aspect ratio of photos that my camera takes (3:2). The logo as a whole alludes to a Polaroid picture with the writing on the bottom.</p>
<p>I also focused a lot on the typography and vertical rhythm of the site. Without a lot of trickery, fonts on the web are pretty limited. I decided to go with Arial. While at lower sizes, I don&#8217;t really care for Arial, but at larger sizes, it actually looks kinda nice (although not quite as nice as Helvetica&#8230; sigh). For some details, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://fadtastic.net/2006/03/12/the-secret-lives-of-fonts/">Georgia&#8230; a font that is superior to Times New Roman</a>. (Update: I am now using Calibri and Arial as a fallback.)</p>
<h3>More in store</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll get back to pounding out the bugs and quirks with the new design now. There are a few sections that I still need to bring online and there are probably some issues somewhere that I didn&#8217;t catch in my beta testing. After things get running smoothly around here again, I&#8217;ll be trying to add nice little features incrementally in my spare time. And don&#8217;t worry&#8230; soon enough I&#8217;ll have a new photo up.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think of the new design, both good and bad. Please drop me a comment.
