<p>At the time, I had never used lights before in my photography and, to be completely honest, I was a little scared of the prospect. I had to learn a lot in a short amount of time so I needed a solid resource. After a little research, I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLight-Science-Introduction-Photographic-Lighting%2Fdp%2F0240808193%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fp%3D304485601%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dlpo-top-stripe-2%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D201%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3D0240802756%26pf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0C1TZMG5N7GE7HE633Q9&#038;tag=shifpixe0b-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325"><cite>Light: Science and Magic</cite></a> to get things started. I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>
<p>Fil Hunter, Steven Biver, and Paul Fuqua ease the novice reader in with very basic lighting concepts focused on two-dimensional subjects. Each chapter builds until you have an understanding of how to light complicated objects like metal and glass. The diagrams and supporting pictures clearly illustrate the concepts, and the writing is very natural and easy to understand. When I finished the book, I had the know-how and confidence to light just about any project.</p>
<p>This is such a great book because the authors teach the principles of lighting instead of just showing you how to achieve certain effects or lighting styles. These principles can be applied to many situations and utilized to achieve any effect you desire. In other words, you won&#8217;t find just a lighting cookbook here. Rather, read this book and you will learn how to <em>think</em> about lighting and understand it from the ground up. This puts you in control of how your photos will look.</p>
<p>If you want to get started with lighting, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLight-Science-Introduction-Photographic-Lighting%2Fdp%2F0240808193%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fp%3D304485601%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dlpo-top-stripe-2%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D201%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3D0240802756%26pf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0C1TZMG5N7GE7HE633Q9&#038;tag=shifpixe0b-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325"><cite>Light: Science and Magic</cite></a> is an essential read.

<p class="leadin">It&#8217;s probably the question I get asked the most…</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the market for a new pro-quality, digital, <acronym title="Single Lens Reflex">SLR</acronym> camera and I wonder if you can tell me what type and model and megapixels you use personally….&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These tips could save you some valuable time and money.<span id="more-706"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Tip 1.</strong> Identify how much you can afford to spend.</h3>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not rich and since camera equipment can get really expensive really fast, this tops my list of considerations. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense to go bankrupt just to buy a new tool or toy.</p>
<p>Look at your personal budget and make sure you can afford a new camera <em>and all of the additional goodies you are going to need to get with it</em>. Take into account lenses, filters, cleaning supplies, extra batteries, memory cards, remote, software, tripod, backpack, light meter, and lighting equipment you plan on getting. If it all doesn&#8217;t pan out, maybe it&#8217;s best to wait or to get something cheaper like <a href="http://www.holgamods.com/">an awesome Holga toy camera</a> to hold you off for a while. <a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/tag/holga/">I love my Holga</a>, and I got it <em>after</em> my <acronym title="Digital Single Lens Reflex">DSLR</acronym>. Or, try your hand at pinhole photography—there&#8217;s a whole world of inexpensive possibilities out there.</p>
<p>Most importantly, get out there and take pictures with whatever you have or can get your hands on. The tools you have or can cheaply get probably aren&#8217;t limiting your ability to cultivate the oh-so-important artistic skills of photography and composition. <strong>Start <em>seeing</em> now and the technology will catch up to you.</strong> If you want proof or inspiration, take a look at <a href="http://outafocus.my-expressions.com/">Susan Burnstine&#8217;s outafocus</a> or <a href="http://www.640x480.net/">Michael Daniel&#8217;s 640&#215;480.net</a>. They are producing some incredible work using very low-fi equipment.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 2.</strong> Decide what you want out of your camera.</h3>
<p>If you already have a decent camera sitting around, take a long, hard look at what you really want to get out of the latest and greatest model.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my Canon 10D for a number of years now and it still does just about everything that I want it to do, even though it has been replaced by the 20D and the 30D. I would really <em>like</em> to have a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11933">Canon 5D</a> because it performs better at higher <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> settings and has a delicious full-frame sensor. But, when I critically look at what I have and what I would be getting by spending a few thousand dollars on a newer model, the difference just doesn&#8217;t add up for me. It would have a much better impact on image quality if I bought some really nice lenses, or maybe a lighting setup.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 3.</strong> Think about how you will use your camera.</h3>
<p><strong>A camera is a tool.</strong> The right tool in the right hands <em>for the right job</em> can produce breathtaking images. But that&#8217;s just it—you need the right camera for the right job.</p>
<p>If you need to do a lot of inconspicuous street shooting, then you&#8217;ll want to find yourself something smaller like a <a href="http://www.leica-camera.us/photography/m_system/m8/">Leica M8</a> or a <a href="http://sigma-dp1.com/">Sigma DP1</a>. If you tend to be rough with your equipment, stay away from cameras with cheaper, plastic bodies like Canon&#8217;s Rebel line. If you are going to be doing a lot of shooting in low-light conditions, focus on cameras that perform better at higher <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> settings, like the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11933">Canon 5D</a>.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the camera you buy needs to fit how you are going to use it. If it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s an expensive paper weight—it will sit on the shelf and collect dust. You&#8217;ll wonder why you didn&#8217;t just buy a cheaper and more convenient point and shoot.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 4.</strong> Establish how you want to use your photos.</h3>
<p>Are your photos going to be for a personal photo album, an online gallery, or gigantic fine art prints?</p>
<p>This question weaves directly into the long-time discussion on megapixels. Do you want to display your photos publicly or just look at them for fun? If you want to display them publicly, do you want to ever print them or just put them on the web? If you are printing your photos, will you ever want them printed at large sizes?</p>
<p>Basically, if you don&#8217;t ever want to print anything at 20&#8243; x 30&#8243;, then you probably don&#8217;t really have to worry too much about megapixels these days. If you are only going to use your pictures on the web, megapixels pretty much don&#8217;t matter at all. And, if you never plan on publicly showing your photos, <em>who cares about megapixels</em>?</p>
<p>For me, the 10D has 6.3 megapixels, which is about as low as I would want to go. I can print a 20&#8243; x 30&#8243; at pretty good quality, but if you look closely it could be a little better. Fortunately, most of the stuff I print is smaller than that so that&#8217;s not that big of a deal—although it would be nice to have a little more flexibility. All of Canon&#8217;s <acronym title="Digital Single Lens Reflex">DSLR</acronym>s right now have 8 megapixels or more, which is plenty for mostly anybody.</p>
<p>If you want to make something really big but don&#8217;t necessarily have the megapixels, try <a href="http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/">Rasterbating</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Tip 5.</strong> Find out what others use and how well it works for them.</h3>
<p><em>Learn from those who have gone before you.</em></p>
<p>Find other photographers whose work you admire and then find out what equipment they are using. This will give you some real-world examples of how the equipment performs and the results it delivers.</p>
<p>If you read a lot of photoblogs, many have a page just to list the equipment they use—<a href="http://shiftingpixel.com/about/my-equipment">here&#8217;s my equipment list</a>. Take advantage of this.</p>
<p>Tap into the power of the Internet. <em>Do your research.</em> There are some very excellent photography review websites that I rely on when considering new purchases—<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/">Digital Photography Review</a>, <a href="http://www.fredmiranda.com/">fredmiranda.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/">Luminous Landscape</a> have all been very helpful for me. Try checking out reviews on Amazon.com or searching and posting in the <a href="http://www.photo.net/community/">photo.net forums</a>. At minimum, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/">check out Flickr&#8217;s Camera Finder</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure to <strong>ask very specific questions</strong> and to <strong>provide as much relevant information as possible</strong>. Simply asking &#8220;what camera should I get?&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to illicit a very valuable response if the person you are asking doesn&#8217;t know how much you want to spend, what you want out of a camera, how you are going to use a camera, and how you want to use your photos. Figure these things out and people will be much more helpful.</p>
<h3><strong>Bonus Tip.</strong> Maximize your investment.</h3>
<p>Look at what you already have and look at what you will get.</p>
<p>After you know what you need and expect to get out of a camera, take stock of the lenses and accessories you already own <em>as well as</em> the additional things you plan to get. Then, try to find an camera that fits in with all of that equipment.</p>
<p>For instance, if you already have a lot of really nice Canon lenses, there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ll get the most bang for your buck out of buying a new Canon body. If you don&#8217;t have any lenses yet, it might be best to start with a cheaper or older body and put the extra money into buying some really decent lenses. Plus this gives you the freedom to consider the qualities and differences of various lens systems and pick the one that will best suit your needs.</p>
<p>All in all, you&#8217;ll be happiest with your purchase if you can spend some time really thinking about what you need and how you plan on using it—otherwise you are just buying an expensive toy.</p>
