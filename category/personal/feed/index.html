			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam and I went to Winterfest, an annual beer tasting event hosted by the <a href="http://www.mncraftbrew.org/">Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild</a>, at the Landmark Center in Saint Paul a few days ago, and we had a great time. We both enjoy drinking beer and love to find rich local fare, so it was the perfect mix. And, the catering was delicious to boot.<br />
<span id="more-599"></span><br />
All in all, I tasted 29 beers brewed from around the state. Here are my notes:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.schellsbrewery.com/">August Schell Brewing Company</a> &mdash; New Ulm</h3>
<p>Since we live so close to the Schell&#8217;s brewery, we get Schell&#8217;s all the time so we pretty much skipped over their beers at Winterfest. That&#8217;s not to say that they weren&#8217;t any good.</p>
<p>On the contrary, their <strong>Snowstorm</strong> this year is a fantastic beer and definitely worth trying. Hurry though, because it&#8217;s only available for a limited time and when it&#8217;s gone, it&#8217;s gone. They switch it out each year for a new style. And, this year it is a London-style sweet stout. Delicious. Stock up.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.barleyjohns.com/">Barley John&#8217;s Brewpub</a> &mdash; New Brighton</h3>
<p>Barley John&#8217;s brought six different beers to Winterfest. Of those, I tried the <strong>Wild Brunette</strong>, a wild rice brown ale, and the <strong>Old 8 Porter</strong> which is a co-winner of last year&#8217;s Winterfest Snowshoe Best of the Fest Award. The Wild Brunette was nice and smooth and the Old 8 Porter had a good flavor and wasn&#8217;t too strong. I enjoyed them both.</p>
<p>They brought another beer, <strong>Rosie&#8217;s Old Ale</strong>, that won this year&#8217;s Snowshoe award. It spends 8 months fermenting and then an additional two years in bourbon barrels.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t try it that night, but since I heard so many good things about it, I went to Barley John&#8217;s the next day and bought myself a glass. It was fantastic. Somehow they managed to maintain a smoothness and sweetness to go alongside the 14% alcohol content. And, it was worth every penny at $9 for a 6 oz. glass.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.braubrothersbrewing.com/">Brau Brothers Brewing Company</a> &mdash; Lucan</h3>
<p>I tried two of the Brau Brothers&#8217; beers, a <strong>strawberry wheat</strong> beer and another that I can&#8217;t remember what it was about. The strawberry wheat was one of the lighter beers that I tried at Winterfest, and it was very refreshing with a nice little strawberry aftertaste to it.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.brewhouse.net">Fitger&#8217;s Brewhouse</a> &mdash; Duluth</h3>
<p>Fitger&#8217;s brought an impressive lineup of nine beers to Winterfest. I had a taste of their <strong>Edmund Imperial Stout</strong>, <strong>Jodicus Wiezenbock</strong>, <strong>Blue Label Grande Reserve</strong>, <strong>El Diablo</strong>, and the <strong>Mr Spock Eisbock</strong>. They were all very good beers and worth enjoying. The Edmund Imperial Stout was smooth and had a nice coffee flavor, while the Jodicus Wiezenbock smelled and finished with a delicious banana flavor. The best of the bunch was probably El Diablo&#8230; it smelled like pineapple and I thought that it had a nice spicy zing to it.</p>
<p>I also had an incredibly delicious <strong>Peace Coffee Java Stout</strong> when I was at Fitger&#8217;s in Duluth a while back. It was thick and dreamy and tasted just like a great glass of coffee-beer should taste. Dear Fitger&#8217;s, please bring back the coffee stout.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.finnegans.org/">Finnegan&#8217;s</a> &mdash; Minneapolis</h3>
<p>Their <strong>Irish Amber Ale</strong> is pretty decent, basic ale. However, I detected a slightly chemically flavor in the beer that I didn&#8217;t really care too much for. Perhaps it is made from potatoes. Either way, all of their profits are donated to community programs for fighting poverty in Minnesota.</p>
<h3><a href="http://flatearthbrewing.com/">Flat Earth Brewing Company</a> &mdash; Saint Paul</h3>
<p>The newest brewery in Minnesota brought <strong>Flat Earth Pale Ale</strong> which was nice a fruity. Unfortunately, I tried to spark up a bit of conversation with the people and they came off as a little crabby and not super friendly. Maybe they were just tired or had a bad day or something, but it didn&#8217;t leave a great impression, especially compared to all of the other friendly people from all of the other breweries.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.gluek.com/">Gluek Brewing Comapny</a> &mdash; Cold Spring</h3>
<p>For me, Gluek brought probably the most disappointing beer that I had at the event. I tried their <strong>STITE Black &amp; Tan</strong> and <strong>Gluek Honey Bock</strong>. Both had pretty pretty good flavors; however, neither were strong enough&#8230; at least not compared to most of the other beers at Winterfest. So, if you are a light beer lover and wanting to expand your horizons into beer that is maybe a little darker, Gluek would be they way to go. On the other hand, if you like a good, strong, dark beer, you&#8217;d be better off with another option.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.gcfb.net/">Granite City Food &amp; Brewery</a> &mdash; St. Cloud</h3>
<p>I tasted their <strong>Broad Axe Stout</strong>, which was pretty good.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.greatwatersbc.com/">Great Waters Brewing Company</a> &mdash; St. Paul</h3>
<p>The first beers of the night for me were the <strong>Yuletide Abbey Ale</strong> and the <strong>King Boreas Imperial Wit</strong>. The Yuletide was a delicious, strong beer, and the King Boreas was equally delicious with hints of nutmeggy goodness. We later came back to try the Hoompfrey Boogardt Belgian Pale Ale which was pretty good.</p>
<h3><a href="http://theherkimer.com/">The Herkimer</a> &mdash; Minneapolis</h3>
<p>I tried the <strong>Daily Pils</strong>, which seemed to be a little sulfury, and the <strong>Bock</strong> which was good and smooth.</p>
<p>If you ever end up going to The Herkimer, I would seriously recommend their sweet potato fries. Mmmm.</p>
<h3>Mantorville Brewing Company &mdash; Mantorville</h3>
<p>I had the <strong>St. Croix Maple Ale</strong> and the <strong>St. Croix Serrano Ale</strong>. While the Maple Ale was good, I don&#8217;t really remember anything that stood out in particular. The Serrano Ale, on the other hand, was very interesting. You see, it is a beer that is made with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serrano_pepper">serrano peppers</a> which gives it a little heat and a nice peppery bite. I would definitely recommend trying this one, especially if you enjoy the flavor of hot peppers.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.townhallbrewery.com/">Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery</a> &mdash; Minneapolis</h3>
<p>Town Hall&#8217;s <strong>Oak Aged Twisted Reality Barley Wine</strong> was absolutely delicious. I haven&#8217;t had too many barley wines, but this one seemed to be quite good. Toward the end of my sample, however, I got a little bit sick of drinking it&#8230; mostly because of its strength and because I probably drank it too quickly. Next time, I&#8217;ll remember that a good barley wine is meant for sipping. I also had their <strong>Winterstorm</strong>, which was very good.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.oharasbrewpub.com/">O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s Brewpub</a> &amp; Restaurant &mdash; Saint Cloud</h3>
<p>Their <strong>Dubbel Trouble</strong> actually won at Winterfest 2003, and I thought that it wasn&#8217;t too bad. It came off as sweet and smooth, overall enjoyable. The <strong>IVP</strong>, I didn&#8217;t have a chance to sample. Sam tried some and didn&#8217;t like it so much that she tossed it before I could take a sip. However, I think it sounds delicious&#8230; It&#8217;s a strong vanilla porter brewed with British pale ale.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.rockbottom.com">Rock Bottom Brewery</a> &mdash; Minneapolis</h3>
<p><strong>Tripel Framboise</strong> was tasty and balanced and had a nice raspberry flavor without going overboard on sweetness like <a href="http://www.leinie.com/">Leinenkugel&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.leinie.com/berry_weiss.html">Berry Weiss</a>. I enjoy many of Rock Bottom&#8217;s beers, and this one seems to fit in well with their other offerings.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.summitbrewing.com/">Summit Brewing Company</a> &mdash; Saint Paul</h3>
<p>By some twist of fate, Summit was the only brewery that I ended up not trying something from. I guess there&#8217;s next year.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.surlybrewing.com">Surly Brewing Company</a> &mdash; Brooklyn Center</h3>
<p>Finally, Surly Brewing Company. I tried three of Surly&#8217;s offerings, their <strong>Cask Bender</strong>, <strong>Darkness</strong>, and their <strong>One</strong>. I thought that all of them were good and very enjoyable. The Cask Bender was the weakest of the three, and unfortunately the sample I received was a little too warm for my taste. Thi s made it more on the okay side than the good side. The Darkness, however, was a Russian Imperial Stout and was strong, dark, and very hopsy. The One, was my favorite out of the three. It was delicious and almost seemed like a beer syrup concentrate&#8211;it was strong.</p>
